"""
Fog of war: per-faction visibility computation.

A hex is *visible* to a faction this frame iff at least one of that faction's
alive units has it within effective vision radius AND no terrain blocks LOS
along the straight hex-line between observer and target.

A hex is *explored* if it has ever been visible — terrain is drawn but live
enemy unit state is hidden. Explored memory is stored per-faction on GameState
and accumulates across turns. Visible state is recomputed (or served cached)
on every query.

Effective vision:
  effective_vision(unit) = max(1, unit.vision + observer_tile.vision_modifier)

LOS:
  - The observer's own hex is always visible.
  - Adjacent hexes (distance 1) are always visible (ignore LOS).
  - For distance ≥ 2, walk hex_line(observer, target); if any intermediate hex
    (not endpoints) blocks LOS, the target is hidden.

Stealth (CP-18 hook):
  can_faction_see_unit() returns False for enemy stealth units unless an own
  unit is within 1 hex of them.
