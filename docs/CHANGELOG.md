# Changelog

Versioning is by Checkpoint (CP). The plan file has full notes; this is
the short version.

## Post-launch additions

### Veterancy + Healing + Zone-of-Control
- **Veterancy**: each unit tracks `xp` and `level` (cap 25). XP from
  damage / kills / surviving counters / captures. 6 ranks (Rookie ->
  Mythic) granting flat +atk / +def / +hp / +vision bonuses. Combat
  formula applies attacker rank to base damage and defender rank to
  defence. Save/load round-trips both fields.
- **Healing**: (a) units standing on **owned capturable tiles**
  (city / oil / airfield / HQ) heal +2 HP at turn start; (b) engineers
  get an active **medic ability (`J`)** -- heal adjacent friendly +3 HP
  for the attack slot (move preserved).
- **Zone of Control**: units adjacent to enemies have movement capped at
  1 hex per turn. Flying units exempt. Selected-unit panel shows the
  `ENGAGED` warning. Makes screening and disengagement genuinely tactical.
- 33 new tests; 702 total green.

### Hunker Down + Retreat + End-turn confirm + HQ clearance
- **Hunker (`H`)**: XCOM-style stance. +2 DEF for incoming, can't attack,
  still counter-attacks. Persists through enemy turn; auto-clears at own
  next turn start.
- **Retreat (`R`)**: auto-pathfind toward own HQ; tiebreak on lowest
  enemy threat. Consumes move + attack.
- **End-turn confirmation modal**: pops when any of your units can still
  act. Y/Enter to confirm, N/Esc to keep playing.
- **HQ surroundings clearance**: scenario loader auto-converts mountain /
  river neighbours of any HQ to plain, so engineers can always deploy.
- 18 new tests; 669 total green.

### Tooltips + resizable window
- Hover any unit or terrain hex for a stat card with combat matchups
  (BEST vs / WEAK vs from real damage matrix) and tactical hints.
- Window is now resizable + maximizable; **F11** toggles native-resolution
  fullscreen. HUD reflows on resize.
- 21 new tooltip tests; 651 total green at this point.

## Phase C (polish + ship)

### CP-27 — Deploy
- Pygbag build + GitHub Pages CI + itch.io packaging tool.
- ASCII-only enforcement on Python source for cp1252-compatible reads.
- 15 deploy-artifact tests (skip-if-no-build).

### CP-26 — Balance pass
- AI-vs-AI simulator (`tools/sim_missions.py`).
- BRICS atk parity fix (`inf_l` and `recon` were strictly better than
  NATO equivalents).
- Engineers buffed across all factions (move 2→3, def 0→1, cheaper).
- New `approach_capture_target` AI weight fixes long-range engineer pull.
- New **Insane** difficulty with "predator" personality.
- 19 balance-lock tests.

### CP-25 — SFX + music
- Procedural WAV generator (stdlib only): 7 SFX + 3 faction music loops.
- `SoundManager` with SDL-dummy-safe init, mute, focus-pause.

### CP-24 — Kenney-ready sprite swap
- `SpriteCache` with headless fallback.
- Procedural placeholder PNG generator (10 terrain + 10 unit icons).
- HexRenderer blits sprites with letter fallback below zoom 20.

## Phase B (content expansion)

### CP-23 — Skirmish mode
- 3 canned maps + seeded procgen.
- Pre-match config: map, faction, AI opponents, victory toggles.

### CP-19 to 22 — Missions 2–5
- M2 Shadow War (hold-tiles), M3 Iron Fist (own-all-oil), M4 Last Stand
  (defense), M5 Decapitation (kill named unit).

### CP-18 — Guerilla + stealth
- 10 Guerilla units, 3 flagships (stealth scout, stealth drone, kamikaze).
- `STEALTH_DETECTION_RADIUS` + AI targeting filter.
- `self_destruct` flag for kamikaze (no counter, attacker dies).

### CP-17 — BRICS roster
- 10 BRICS units; T3 Iskander-M (range 4–7, atk 9).

## Phase A (vertical slice)

### CP-16 — Main menu + pre-match
- 4-screen state machine. Pre-match difficulty + faction. Load menu with
  autosave + 3 slots.

### CP-15 — Save / autosave
- JSON v1 schema. Autosave per end-turn; 3 manual slots cycle.

### CP-14 — Mission 1
- Scenario JSON loader. m1.json with river + bridge choke.

### CP-13 — AI v0
- Heuristic enumerate→score→execute loop. Personality system.

### CP-12 — Victory engine
- 5 condition types: destroy_hq, hold_tiles, own_all_terrain,
  eliminate_faction, destroy_unit_type. AND/OR composition.

### CP-11 — Build menu + tech
- Click HQ → tier-filtered menu. Instant tier upgrades.

### CP-10 — Capture + economy
- 3-turn engineer capture. Income tick before unit reset.

### CP-9 — Combat resolver
- Damage matrix. Predict = resolve. Counter-attack logic.

### CP-8 — Fog of war

- Persistent explored memory.

### CP-7 — Movement + path preview
- Dijkstra reachable. Friendly pass-through, enemy block.

### CP-2 — Hex math
- Axial coords. Neighbours, distance, ring, disk, line, pixel↔hex.

### CP-1 — Pygbag scaffold
- Async loop, requirements.txt, archived original `tankv1.py`.
