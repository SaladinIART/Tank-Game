# Saladin's Playground

A turn-based modern-warfare 4X built in Python + pygame-ce. Plays in a desktop
window or in the browser via [Pygbag](https://pygame-web.github.io).

> Hex map. Three asymmetric factions (NATO / BRICS / Guerilla).
> 5 hand-crafted missions + skirmish mode + procedurally-generated maps.
> Capture-based economy, fog of war, stealth, kamikaze drones, XCOM-style
> hunker-down stance, retreat orders, three difficulty tiers (Normal / Hard
> / Insane).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py           # desktop
